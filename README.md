# Stress Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting stress levels using machine learning techniques. It comprises data preprocessing, model training, and visualization components to provide insights into factors contributing to stress.

## Project Structure

- **`ML_Project.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **`Stress Prediction.xls`**: Dataset used for training and evaluating the machine learning models.
- **`Dashboard.pbix`**: Power BI dashboard visualizing key findings and predictions from the analysis.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sapna-Singh10/Stress-Prediction.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Stress-Prediction
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

   - Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed. If not, install it using:

     ```bash
     pip install notebook
     ```

   - Launch the notebook:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

   - Open `ML_Project.ipynb` to view and execute the code.

4. **View the Power BI Dashboard**:

   - Open `Dashboard.pbix` using Power BI Desktop to interact with the visualizations.

## Dependencies

The project utilizes the following Python libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

### Data Analysis and Model Training

The Jupyter Notebook guides you through loading the dataset, performing exploratory data analysis, preprocessing data, and training machine learning models to predict stress levels.

### Visualization

The Power BI dashboard provides interactive visualizations to better understand the factors influencing stress and the model's predictions.
