# üöÄ Stress Prediction

üîç This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **stress levels** using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and visualization to gain insights into stress-inducing factors.

## üóÇ Project Structure

- üìì **`ML_Project.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with preprocessing, EDA, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- üìä **`Stress Prediction.xls`**: Dataset used for training and evaluation.
- üìà **`Dashboard.pbix`**: Power BI dashboard with key visualizations and predictions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

To explore and run the project:

1. **üì• Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sapna-Singh10/Stress-Prediction.git
   ```

2. **üìÇ Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Stress-Prediction
   ```

3. **üìó Open the Jupyter Notebook**:

   - Make sure Jupyter Notebook is installed. If not:

     ```bash
     pip install notebook
     ```

   - Launch the notebook:

     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

   - Open `ML_Project.ipynb` and start exploring.

4. **üìä View the Power BI Dashboard**:

   - Open `Dashboard.pbix` using Power BI Desktop.

## üì¶ Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

Install them with:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## üß† Usage

### üìâ Data Analysis and Model Training

The notebook guides you through loading the dataset, conducting EDA, preprocessing data, and training ML models for stress prediction.

### üìä Visualization

Interactive visualizations in Power BI help understand stress factors and model outputs.
